Definition:-

----->	Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits 
	another objectâ€™s properties, and inheritance also supports 
	hierarchical classification. 
----->	The idea behind this is that we can create new classes built on
	existing classes, i.e., when you inherit from an existing class,
	we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. 	
----->	Inheritance represents the parent-child relationship.

	For example, a whale is a part of the classification of marine animals, 
	which is part of class mammal, which is under that class of animal. 
	We use hierarchical classification, i.e., top-down classification. 
	If we want to describe a more specific class of animals such as mammals, 
	they would have more specific attributes such as teeth; cold-blooded, 
	warm-blooded, etc. This comes under the subclass of animals where animals 
	come under superclass. The subclass is a class which inherits properties 
	of the superclass. 
	This is also called a derived class. A superclass is a base class or
	parental class from which subclass inherits properties.

	We use inheritance mainly for method overriding. To inherit a class, we 
	use the extend 	keyword.

	Three are three types of inheritance:
	*************************************
	-------------->	Single inheritance
	-------------->	Multiple inheritance
	-------------->	Hierarchical level
